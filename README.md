Trend Analyzer
==============

The program
-----------

The programs are meant to predict trends in multidimensional datasets. If you have a data set with parameters more than three there will be difficulties visualizing it. That's why these two programs are made, to help visualizing the data set but not producing a graph, but predicting regions or scalar values in the other points in the multidimensional space.

There are two programs here stored in this repository,

1. Discrete Trend Analyzer

2. Scalar Trend Analyzer

Discrete Trend Analyzer
-----------------------

This program can be used to treat data-set where there are discrete qualitative outcomes associated with each point in the parameter space. It accepts a table of data, where there columns for parameters, and columns for discrete properties. The program will generate outputs for predictive
